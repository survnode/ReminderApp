      This is a routine reminder for you to start working with a new monthly database from <b>1<sup>st</sup> %secDateFormat</b> which you can access
      through your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/">Google Sheets Homepage</a>. Reminders in the %todDateFormat file will be deactivated %delTrigDays
      days after the <b><u>last</u></b> reminder is sent.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;font-size: 16px; color: #222">   
      Remember to <u>authorize the application and then activate reminders</u> in the new file to automate email notifications; this is only done once per file. The new
      %secondDateFormat  file has been shared with all accounts that currently have %todDateFormat privileges.</p>

      The <i>Reminder App</i> is an internal-use application that has not been published on Google Apps Marketplace. Google considers such an application unsafe since
      it's <a href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865?hl=en#">unverified</a> for public use. In case you have trouble authorizing
      the app or activating the reminders, you can view a tutorial of the process below.</p>
